# Movie_Rating_AndroidApp
Used to display movies and being able to rate them.
Was done using Node.js,Android studio and Aidl from Android studio.
You are able to make a GET request for a list of movies that is a JSON string.
We can display specific information for each movie and rate it at the end of the page.
We make a POST request and update the backend(usually MongoDB or SQL but I used a txt for simplicity).
This is just a template and can be improved.
